 *
 * @brief
 * The Sonic Library implements a new algorithm invented by Bill Cox for the specific purpose of speeding up
 * speech by high factors at high quality.  It generates smooth speech at speed up factors as high as 6X,
 * possibly more.  It is also capable of slowing down speech, and generates high quality results regardless
 * of the speed up or slow down factor.
 *
 * For speeding up speech by 2X or more, the following equation is used:
 *
 *     new_samples = period / (speed - 1.0)
 *     scale = 1.0 / new_samples;
 *
 * where `period` is the current pitch period, determined using AMDF or any other pitch estimator, and
 * `speed` is the speedup factor.  If the current position in the input stream is pointed to by `samples`,
 * and the current output stream position is pointed to by `out`, then `new_samples` number of samples can
 * be generated with:
 *
 *     out[t] = (samples[t] * (new_samples - t) + samples[t + period] * t) / new_samples;
 *
 * where t = 0 to new_samples - 1.
 *
 * For speed factors < 2X, the PICOLA algorithm is used.  The above algorithm is first used to double the
 * speed of one pitch period.  Then, enough input is directly copied from the input to the output to achieve
 * the desired speed up factor, where 1.0 < speed < 2.0.  The amount of data copied is derived:
 *
 *     speed = (2 * period + length) / (period + length)
 *     speed * length + speed * period = 2 * period + length
 *     length(speed - 1) = 2 * period - speed * period
 *     length = period * (2 - speed) / (speed - 1)
 *
 * For slowing down speech where 0.5 < speed < 1.0, a pitch period is inserted into the output twice, and
 * length of input is copied from the input to the output until the output desired speed is reached.  The
 * length of data copied is:
 *
 *     length = period * (speed - 0.5) / (1 - speed)
 *
 * For slow down factors below 0.5, no data is copied, and an algorithm similar to high speed factors is
 * used.
